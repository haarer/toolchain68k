 * 
 *  @brief Interrupt UART library using the built-in UART with transmit and receive circular buffers. 
 *
 *  This library can be used to transmit and receive data through the built in UART. 
 *
 *  An interrupt is generated when the UART has finished transmitting or
 *  receiving a byte. The interrupt handling routines use circular buffers
 *  for buffering received and transmitted data.
 *
 *  The UART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE and UART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE constants define
 *  the size of the circular buffers in bytes. Note that these constants must be a power of 2.
 *  You may need to adapt these constants to your target and your application by adding 
 *  CDEFS += -DUART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE=nn -DUART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE=nn to your Makefile.
 *
 *  @note Based on Atmel Application Note AVR306
